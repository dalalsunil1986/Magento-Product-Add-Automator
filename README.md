# Magento-Product-Add-Automator
This is a command-line script written in Java that scrapes product details from the site http://www.sincerewedding.com/ and adds them to the backend of the site http://www.mariellonline.com/ (the backend is implemented using Magento).

The script logs into the magento site using a predefined login credential and adds the products (including product images scraped from the other site).
